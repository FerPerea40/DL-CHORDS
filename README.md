# # DL-Chords-Android

This Android application was developed in collaboration with my classmates [Carlos](https://github.com/CarlitosObr) and [Fernando](https://github.com/FernandoPerea).

DL Chords refers to "Deep Learning Chords". We decided to name our application this way, because through the use of neural networks, we obtain the musical chords from an audio stored in our mobile device. 

### What does this mobile application do?
This application obtains the musical chords and the lyrics (in Spanish) from an audio stored in the mobile device.
